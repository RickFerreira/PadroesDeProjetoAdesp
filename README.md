### 👨🏻‍💻 Development Flow
<br>

<div align="left">

1. You will look at the list of issues labeled "To dev";
2. Then, add your signature to the issue to indicate that it is assigned to you;
3. Remove the "To dev" label and add the "Developing" label to indicate that development of the issue has started;
4. Now, locally, with the project already cloned on your machine, you will use the "git branch" command to check which branch you are on;
5. If you are not on the main branch, switch to it using the command "git checkout main";
6. Within the main branch, create your branch related to that issue you signed up for using the command "git checkout -b branchname";
7. By default, we will adopt the branch name format as follows: issue number-branch name. For example, if the name is "create class" and the issue is "#1", it would be "1-createClass";
8. After creating your branch, verify that everything was done correctly and that you are within it using the command "git branch";
9. Now, you can proceed with everything requested for this issue, have a good development ;-)
10. After making all the modifications you want, follow the commit process using "git init", "git status", "git add .", "git commit -m  “Description message”", and "git push";
11. Use this pattern in the commit message: feature #issue number - Commit message phrase;
12. If the issue is completed, you will remove the "Developing" label and add the "Code review" label;
13. At this point, you need to open a merge request to the main branch, and someone else will review your code and perform the merge;
14. Now, you can pick another issue and repeat the process;
15. If you are going to review someone else's code, make the necessary changes and then accept the merge to the main branch.
